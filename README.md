# Auth0 Integration

Set up a passwordless login experience with BindID to access your Auth0 web instance.
## Description

This plugin is used to configure your Auth0 instance to initiate strong authentication flows with the BindID service to sign in and sign up users to your application. The plugin also adds support for user account linking, which can be used to link BindID users to existing identities in Auth0 (such as Auth0 or Google).

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure that you have Editor - Connections permission in your Auth0 management dashboard (see [Auth0 docs](https://auth0.com/docs/dashboard-access)).

## What is BindID?
The BindID service is an app-less, strong portable authenticator offered by Transmit Security. BindID uses FIDO-based biometrics for secure, frictionless, and consistent customer authentication. With one click to create new accounts or sign into existing ones, BindID eliminates passwords and the inconveniences of traditional credential-based logins.<br><br>
